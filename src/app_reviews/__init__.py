"""app-reviews: Python package for App Store and Google Play reviews.

This module is the API. Every name below is importable straight from
``app_reviews``, and that is the supported way in:

    from app_reviews import AppStoreReviews, Country, Sort

Reviews come back as ``Review`` objects; ``FetchResult.to_dicts()`` gives you
JSON-serialisable plain dicts when you want to hand them to ``json`` or ``csv``.

Nothing else needs importing from a submodule path, which is deliberate: it is
what lets the package's internal shape change without breaking callers. Two
submodules are reasonable to reach into anyway, both documented:

- ``app_reviews.appstore`` / ``app_reviews.googleplay`` expose that store's
  provider classes, for driving a specific provider or building your own client.
  Single-app metadata lives on the search clients: ``AppStoreSearch().lookup(id)``.
- ``app_reviews.core`` is the store-agnostic engine. Internal, no promises.

The imports below are grouped by role; ``__all__`` stays alphabetical.
