    """App metadata from a store lookup.

    Text and number fields are non-optional, so a store that does not publish one
    reports a stated placeholder rather than ``None``. Two are worth knowing about.
    A Play *search* hit carries no rating count, so ``rating_count`` is ``0`` unless
    it came from ``lookup()`` or was the one featured hit. And ``version`` on Play
    is ``"Varies with device"`` for an app that ships per-device variants, which is
    what the store itself shows; ``lookup()`` returns the real version for an app
    that publishes one. A Play search hit never carries a version.

    The two dates are the exception to that convention: they are ``None`` when
    absent, because a date has no honest placeholder. A sentinel would sort, filter
    and diff as though it were real, which is exactly how Play reviews once came
    back dated to 1973.

    See the coverage table in ``docs/reference/models.md``.

    ``price`` is formatted with ``$`` regardless of storefront currency.
