    ``id`` is the raw store identifier, unique within a ``(store, source)``

    ``(store, source, id)``.

    ``country`` is the storefront that was queried, not the reviewer's
    location. ``None`` means the source does not report it.

    ``title`` is ``None`` where the source has no title concept; Google Play
    reviews have no titles.

    No source reports both timestamps, so exactly one of ``created_at`` and
    ``updated_at`` is set and it is the field that source orders by. Read
    ``dated_at`` when you want the one that is there.

        Two decisions live here because this class owns the fields they concern.

        ``raw`` is excluded unless asked for: it is the provider's own payload,
        kept so a fetch can be reprocessed later, and it routinely dwarfs the
        review around it. When included it is passed through by reference rather
        than copied: ``dataclasses.asdict`` recursively copied it even on the
        path that immediately discarded it, which cost ~23x the whole conversion.

        Timestamps become ISO 8601 strings via ``isoformat()``. Serialising them
        with ``str()`` yields a space where ISO wants a ``T``, which strict
        parsers downstream reject.
