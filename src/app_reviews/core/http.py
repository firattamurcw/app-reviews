whole backoff schedule is spent before the caller is told.

``httpx.HTTPError`` covers every ``RequestError`` subclass (connection failures,
timeouts, protocol errors, too-many-redirects) plus ``HTTPStatusError``. It does
not cover ``httpx.InvalidURL``, which subclasses ``Exception`` directly, so a
malformed URL (``"http://[::1"``, or one with a stray tab) raises past a bare
``except httpx.HTTPError``. httpx parses the URL on every request call, which is
what makes ``InvalidURL`` reachable here.

Deliberately excluded: ``httpx.CookieConflict``, raised only by explicit
``Cookies.get()`` lookups. That would mean a bug in this code rather than a
transport failure, and must propagate.

``httpx.StreamError`` subclasses ``HTTPError`` and so *is* covered. This module
does stream every response (see ``_read``), and a stream consumed twice or read
after closing is a bug here, not a transport failure, but the family also
covers genuine mid-body truncation, which is. Treating the pair as retryable
transport failures is the safer default: a real bug in ``_read`` fails loudly in
the suite long before it reaches a retry.

    Two jobs. Connection reuse: one pool for this client's lifetime, so a ten-page
    walk costs one TLS handshake rather than ten. And the injection seam:
    ``transport`` is a constructor parameter of the object that actually performs
    the I/O, which is where a test can substitute one.

    ``timeout``, ``proxy`` and ``retry`` are client state rather than per-call
    arguments: they describe how this client talks to a host, not what any one
    request wants.

    Both pools are lazy and independent, so a sync-only caller never constructs
    an ``AsyncClient`` (which would want a running loop) and vice versa. Building
    either is guarded by a lock: ``fetch`` fans out across threads on one shared
    client, and a bare check-then-set let concurrent first use build several pools
    and keep only the last, leaving the rest open with nothing able to close them.
    ``httpx.Client`` itself is safe to *use* from many threads.

    Redirects are followed because the iTunes endpoints need them. That is safe for
    credentialed requests only because httpx drops ``Authorization`` on any origin
    change; ``tests/app_reviews/core/test_http.py`` pins that, since it is
    behaviour of a pinned dependency rather than of this code.
