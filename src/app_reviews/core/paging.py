"""What the ladder branches on: per-source facts, and the decisions a walk makes.

``reviews.py`` owns the loops. Everything they *decide* is here, once, so the sync
and async bodies (which cannot share code, an async generator being a different
animal) cannot drift apart.

The two per-source facts live here too. They are dispatch, not a published
capability table: one gates the country fan-out and the other gates the ``since``
early stop, and keeping the pair adjacent means a fifth source is one edit rather
than two. "How do these sources differ" is a question you have while *writing*
code, so it is answered in ``docs/reference/capabilities.md``.
