        value already in the past, in either form, means "now".

        NaN is rejected rather than clamped. It parses as a float, so it used to
        reach the clamp, where every comparison against it is False, making
        ``max(0.0, nan)`` return ``0.0`` and a throttled client retry with no
        backoff at all. Unlike ``-10`` it names no instant, so "unusable" is the
        honest reading and the exponential schedule applies. ``inf`` does name an
        instant and stays: ``get_delay`` caps it, and for a 429 the safe error is
        waiting too long.
