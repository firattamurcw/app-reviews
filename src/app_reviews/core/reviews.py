    """Base reviews client.

    Four rungs, each built on the one below and mirrored sync/async:

    - ``fetch_page``: one request. Cursor in, cursor out. Persist the cursor
      to resume the walk later, in another process if you like.
    - ``iter_pages``: one country, paginated. Owns the ``since`` early stop.
    - ``iter_reviews``: every country, streamed one review at a time.
    - ``fetch``: all countries, concurrent, filtered and sorted.

    **Start at ``fetch``.** It is the one that answers "give me this app's
    reviews"; the rungs below it exist for callers who need to bound memory, own
    the pagination, or checkpoint a walk.

    The rungs deliberately disagree about failure, because what a caller *can* do
    about one differs by rung. Reading down the ladder:

    ===============  ==========================================================
    Rung             What a failed page does
    ===============  ==========================================================
    ``fetch_page``   Returns the page with ``.error`` set. Nothing is retried
                     past the HTTP client's own policy; you decide.
    ``iter_pages``   Yields that page, with ``.error`` and ``stopped_because ==
                     "error"``, then stops. Earlier pages already reached you.
    ``iter_reviews`` Logs and moves to the next country. A stream of reviews has
                     nowhere to put an error object, and one dead storefront
                     should not end a 155-storefront walk.
    ``fetch``        Records it on that country's ``CountryOutcome``, which
                     ``FetchResult.errors`` reads back. Reviews from the
                     countries that worked are still returned.
    ===============  ==========================================================

    ``AuthError`` is the carve-out at every rung: it is raised, not reported. An
    unusable credential is configuration, identical for every country and page,
    so reporting it N times would bury the one fact that matters.

        ``sort`` is coerced because ``Sort`` is a ``StrEnum`` and the equivalent

        above, and on a newest-first walk a review older than ``since`` can
        never appear before that boundary, so it cannot be filtered away
