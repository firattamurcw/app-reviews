# Async

Every entry point has an async twin using real async I/O over `httpx`, not a
thread-pool wrapper.

| sync | async |
|---|---|
| `fetch()` | `afetch()` |
| `iter_reviews()` | `aiter_reviews()` |
| `iter_pages()` | `aiter_pages()` |
| `fetch_page()` | `afetch_page()` |
| `search()` | `asearch()` |
| `lookup()` | `alookup()` |
| `close()` / `with` | `aclose()` / `async with` |

```python
import asyncio

from app_reviews import AppStoreReviews, Country


async def main():
    client = AppStoreReviews()
    result = await client.afetch(
        "324684580", countries=[Country.US, Country.GB]
    )
    for outcome in result.outcomes:
        print(outcome.country, outcome.reviews_fetched, outcome.stopped_because)


asyncio.run(main())
```

`afetch()` fans out across countries with `asyncio.gather` behind a semaphore, with
no threads. `concurrency=1` makes it sequential.

```python
async def walk_pages(client):
    async for page in client.aiter_pages("324684580", country="us"):
        await store(page.reviews)
```

```python
async def stream_reviews(client):
    async for review in client.aiter_reviews("324684580", countries=["us", "gb"]):
        await handle(review)
```

The sync path is a separate implementation, not a wrapper around the async one,
so calling `fetch()` from inside a running event loop is safe.

Async credential work stays off the event loop: the Google Play token exchange
is awaited, and App Store JWT signing, which is blocking local work with no
async equivalent, runs in a thread. Either way it happens once per client, not
once per request.

## Closing the pool

Each client owns one connection pool, so its sockets outlive a single request.
Use `async with`, or call `aclose()`:

```python
async def main():
    async with AppStoreReviews() as client:
        result = await client.afetch("324684580")
```

---

## Async search and lookup

`AppStoreSearch` and `GooglePlaySearch` follow the same pattern:

```python
from app_reviews import AppStoreSearch


async def main():
    results = await AppStoreSearch().asearch("fitness tracker")
    app = await AppStoreSearch().alookup("com.burbn.instagram")
```

## Async metadata lookup

```python
from app_reviews import AppStoreSearch


async def main():
    metadata = await AppStoreSearch().alookup("123456789")
```
